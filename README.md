# Self-Driving-Car-With-No-Libraries

This project aims at developing a neural network using JavaScript with no libraries, and shows how artificial neural networks work, by comparing them with the real neural networks in our brain. 
## The core features of this project includes:
1. Implementation of car driving mechanics.
2.  It defines the environment (Road, car traffic and Road borders).
3.  It simulates car sensor
4.  And detects collisions, and makes the car to control itself using a neural network.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough video thats shows how the model (car) was trained to make decision in the future as every best decision it makes i saved it in JSON file which acts as its memory for future reference when it faces the same scenerio.

Here's a walkthrough video of well trained model and implementing self driving with visual neural network illustration next to it.
