# Self-Driving-Car-With-No-Libraries

This project aims at developing a neural network using JavaScript with no libraries, and shows how artificial neural networks work, by comparing them with the real neural networks in our brain. 
## The core features of this project includes:
1. Implementation of the car driving mechanics.
2.  It defines the environment.
3.  It also simulates some  car sensors.
4.   And detects collisions, and makes the car to control itself using a neural network.
